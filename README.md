# Pastebin Android application

Beta application, since it's my first "serious" android application it's not the best at all as application.

# Features
* Fast post
* Show the paste in the application
* Fork the paste and create your own copy of it

# Bugs

# ToDo
* Improve main.xml file (too much LinearLayout)
* User system login
* Activity to show account pastes and local pastes
